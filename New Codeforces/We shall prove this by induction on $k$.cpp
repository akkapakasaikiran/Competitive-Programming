 We shall prove this by induction on $k$. \\
    Base case is $k = 0$. Part (a) follows from lemma 3.4 (will be renamed appropriately later) as $\eta = \sigma(\gamma)$,
    and $\beta(t) = \alpha \cdot \gamma^t$ is applicable to ${\bf
    x}$ because there are no no $\omega$-nodes above $p$ in
    $\mathbb{T}({\bf x, V})$.
